# Turning Up The Vote: The 2019 Federal Election at Full Voter Turnout

Voter turnout is significant to both democracy and electoral chances. Yet, every federal election cycle, millions of eligible Canadians do not cast a ballot. This paper considers the 2019 Federal Election at full voter turnout. Using several logistic regression models with post-stratification, we estimate changes in vote shares under the assumption that everyone participates in the political process. Our results show changes in vote share for every political party. However, centerist and regional parties, such as the Liberals and Bloc Quebecois, would capture fewer votes at this level of engagement, compared to their more partisan counterparts. Code and data supporting this analysis are available in this repository.
